***xuebadb*** is a python package that allows users to conveniently connect to and query from various database systems using a unified API. Currently, it supports connecting to *MySQL* and *SQL Server* database systems. The queries return Pandas dataframes which can then be cleaned up and analysed using one of the modules in the package.
